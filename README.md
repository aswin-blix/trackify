## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) ≥ 3.0.0
- Android SDK (for Android builds)
- A physical or virtual Android device

### Clone & Run

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/aswin-blix/trackify.git
cd trackify

# 2. Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# 3. Run on connected device
flutter run
```

### Build Release APK

```bash
flutter build apk --release --no-tree-shake-icons
# Output: build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

> **Note:** The `--no-tree-shake-icons` flag is required because category icons are stored as integer codepoints in Hive and resolved at runtime via `IconData(codePoint, fontFamily: 'MaterialIcons')`.

### Install on Device (ADB)

```bash
adb install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

## Architecture Notes

- **Hive adapters are hand-written** — the `.g.dart` files are checked in. Do not run `build_runner`.
- **Settings state** — `AppSettings` is cloned via `fromJson`/`toJson` on every update so Riverpod detects the change. Mutation-in-place won't work.
- **Tab indices** in `HomeShell`: `0`=Dashboard, `1`=Transactions, `2`=FAB (opens sheet), `3`=Analytics, `4`=Settings.
- **fl_chart v0.68** — does not accept `duration`/`curve` at the chart widget level.

## Permissions (Android)

| Permission | Why |
|---|---|
| `READ_SMS` | SMS Bank Reader — reads bank transaction messages locally |
| `USE_BIOMETRIC` / `USE_FINGERPRINT` | App Lock |
| `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` | Daily reminder notifications |
| `CAMERA` / `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` | Profile avatar picker |
| `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` | Reschedule notifications after reboot |

All permissions are optional. Core tracking works without any of them.
